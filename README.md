# HOW TO MAKE THEMES! 

1. MAKE A TXT

2. ADD THIS TO IT: {"fg_color": "#23ff3a", "text_color": "#183517", "button_color": "#183517", "slider_button_color": "#183517"}
   # PUT HEX CODES INTO THIS, EXAMPLE: #A7F631 (greenish yellow)

   (This website is a very lightweight way to get color codes: *https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/*
